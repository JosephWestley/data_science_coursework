# Hatching Coursework

This is a pipeline written in Python that investiagtes what variables correlate with probability of survival to fledging in white-browed sparrow weaver chicks. Variables tested include hatch day mass, month of breeding season chicks hatches in, and egg volume. Egg volume isn't a variable present in the dataset, so this pipeline also estimates egg volume from egg width and length, using the equation for calculating the volume of an ellipsoid. The pipeline is written in JupyterLab notebook format. The hatching.csv data originated from data collected by The Sparrow Weaver Project, run by Dr Andrew Young at the University of Exeter.

To run this pipeline:

1. Ensure you have JupyterLab installed.
2. Download the hatching.csv file, and the Hatching_coursework.ipynb file, into the same directory.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook file Hatching_coursework.ipynb. 
4. Ensure the current working directory is set to the directory containing Hatching_coursework.ipynb and hatching.csv.
5. Run the scripts within Hatching_coursework.ipynb via the JupyterLab GUI.
